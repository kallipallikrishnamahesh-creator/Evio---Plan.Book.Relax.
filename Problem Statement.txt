Problem Statement

In today’s fast-moving lifestyle, people frequently organize or participate in various types of events — weddings, birthday parties, college fests, corporate functions, religious or cultural celebrations, and family gatherings.
However, planning and managing these events is still one of the most stressful and confusing tasks, especially when multiple services and sub-events are involved.

For example, in a wedding, there are multiple sub-functions such as:
	Engagement
	Mehandi
	Sangeet
	Haldi
	Bachelor’s Party
	Reception

Each of these may require separate venues, different food menus, unique decorations, music, photography, and lighting setups. Coordinating all these manually becomes a nightmare — especially when users have to contact each service provider separately and handle multiple payments, confirmations, and reminders.

The Core Problems Faced by Users

Scattered Planning:
People rely on several different tools — WhatsApp for communication, Google Calendar for reminders, separate websites for venues, and manual calls for caterers or photographers. This fragmented approach causes confusion and mismanagement.

Availability Conflicts:
It’s common for venues or vendors to already be booked on the desired dates. Users often find this out late, wasting valuable time.

No Centralized View:
There’s no single dashboard to view all bookings, costs, and event timelines in one place.

Manual Coordination:
Users need to call or message each vendor individually to finalize details like menus, themes, or schedules, leading to communication errors and inconsistent information.

No Real-time Updates:
Even after booking, there’s no live update mechanism to confirm availability changes, cancellations, or time shifts.

Double Booking & Missed Reminders:
Without automatic synchronization, users face overlaps in schedules or miss key reminders.

Lack of Transparency:
Comparing prices, checking vendor reviews, or getting clear cost breakdowns is difficult because most local vendors don’t have a digital presence
