Solution: All-in-One Event Management Platform
What is the Solution?
A single digital platform where users can plan, book, and manage every aspect of any event—from weddings and birthdays to college fests and family functions—in one place.

How It Works --
	1. Unified Dashboard	
		Upon logging in, the user accesses a personalized dashboard.
		From this dashboard, users can:
		Create a main event (e.g., Wedding, College Fest, Birthday, etc.)
		Add sub-events such as Engagement, Mehandi, Sangeet, or specific fest segments.
		For each sub-event, they can:
		Select venues (with availability calendars)
		Choose food menus or catering services
		Book decorators, musicians, photographers, makeup artists, and transport services
		Assign different budgets and themes to individual events
		This central hub lets users visualize the entire event structure, ensuring no detail is overlooked.

	2. Real-Time Availability & Booking
		The platform features live integration with local venues and vendors.
		Users can:
			View available vendors or venues for selected dates
			Instantly book or block slots
			Compare prices, read reviews, and check ratings before making decisions	
			Prevent double-booking errors with an automatic conflict prevention system
			This real-time synchronization ensures that every booking is confirmed and updated for both parties.

	3. End-to-End Coordination
		Instead of juggling multiple apps and messages, all event communication happens within the platform:
		Vendors and clients receive instant notifications for each update—approvals, confirmations, or changes.
		The built-in chat and approval system simplifies communication (such as confirming flower arrangements or menu items).
		Organizers can assign roles or permissions to family members, team leads, or coordinators to manage different parts of the event collaboratively.
		This creates a streamlined, paperless workflow that eliminates ambiguity.

	4. Automatic Reminders & Conflict Prevention
		Using integrated smart scheduling:
		The platform syncs with Google Calendar, phone calendar, and email.	
		Automated reminders go out for upcoming events, payments, delivery timelines, and rehearsals.
		AI-driven conflict detection flags overlapping bookings or time clashes, helping users reschedule instantly.
		This intelligent feature ensures smooth timing and zero last-minute surprises.

	5. Transparent Pricing & Secure Payments
		Every booking or service is accompanied by a clear cost breakdown:
		Users can see package inclusions, taxes, and extra charges upfront.
		The platform allows secure transactions through various payment gateways—credit/debit cards, UPI, net banking, or wallets.
		A split payment option lets users pay partially—ideal for phased vendor settlements.
		Additionally, the platform maintains receipts, invoices, and payment histories automatically, aiding transparency and accountability.

	The app suggests available venues for each date and decor options matching the selected theme.
	The user books a photographer and caterer from verified listings with transparent packages.
